# WLAN Network Modeling Workshop 


This repo contains the files required to run the hands-on WLAN network modeling workshop in MATLAB&reg;. The "Exercise" files require code additions to  
run.  The "Solution Scripts" files have the required code additions and run  
to completion.

The files enable the following exercises:  
1.  Exercise 1 - Operate the simulation engine, configure WLAN nodes, create a simple network, and see statistics  
2.  Exercise 2 - Configure traffic models, visualize QoS, and enable PCAP logging.  
3.  Exercise 3 - Implement custom channel models 
4.  Exercise 4 - Schedule action and interact with the simulation engine 
5.  Exercise 5 - Simulate a network with MLO nodes(WiFi-7)

## Setup 
To Run:
1. To conduct the workshop, use the "Exercise" files
2. To simply run the completed exercises, run the following files in MATLAB:
- EX1_WLAN_SYS_basics_Soln.mlx
- EX2_WLAN_SYS_PCAP_Basics_Soln.mlx
- EX3_WLAN_SYS_CustomChannelModel_Soln.mlx
- EX4_WLAN_SYS_Action_Scheduling_Soln.mlx
- EX5_WLAN_SYS_MLO_Soln.mlx
